('2 Chronicles', 29, 34, "But the priests were too few and could not flay all the burnt offerings, so until other priests had consecrated themselves, their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was finished- for the Levites were more upright in heart than the priests in consecrating themselves."),
('2 Chronicles', 29, 35, "Besides the great number of burnt offerings, there was the fat of the peace offerings, and there were the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. Thus the service of the house of the LORD was restored."),

('2 Chronicles', 30, 16, "They took their accustomed posts according to the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests threw the blood that they received from the hand of the Levites."),
('2 Chronicles', 30, 17, "For there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves. Therefore the Levites had to slaughter the Passover lamb for everyone who was not clean, to consecrate it to the LORD."),
('2 Chronicles', 30, 18, "For a majority of the people, many of them from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover otherwise than as prescribed. For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, \"May the good LORD pardon everyone"),
