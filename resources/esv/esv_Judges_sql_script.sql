('Judges', 4, 11, "Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh."),
('Judges', 4, 12, "When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,"),
('Judges', 4, 13, "Sisera called out all his chariots, 900 chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon."),
('Judges', 4, 14, "And Deborah said to Barak, \"Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Does not the LORD go out before you?\" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him."),
('Judges', 4, 15, "And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot."),
('Judges', 4, 16, "And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left."),
('Judges', 4, 17, "But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite."),
('Judges', 4, 18, "And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, \"Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me; do not be afraid.\" So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug."),
('Judges', 4, 19, "And he said to her, \"Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.\" So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him."),
('Judges', 4, 20, "And he said to her, \"Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, 'Is anyone here?' say, 'No.'\""),
('Judges', 4, 21, "But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died."),
('Judges', 4, 22, "And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, \"Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.\" So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple."),
('Judges', 4, 23, "So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel."),
('Judges', 4, 24, "And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan."),
('Judges', 5, 1, "Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day:"),
('Judges', 5, 2, "\"That the leaders took the lead in Israel, that the people offered themselves willingly, bless the LORD!"),
