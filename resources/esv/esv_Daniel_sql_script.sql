('Daniel', 3, 28, "Nebuchadnezzar answered and said, \"Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants, who trusted in him, and set aside the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God."),
('Daniel', 3, 29, "Therefore I make a decree: Any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb, and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who is able to rescue in this way.\""),

('Daniel', 4, 4, "I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and prospering in my palace."),
('Daniel', 4, 5, "I saw a dream that made me afraid. As I lay in bed the fancies and the visions of my head alarmed me."),
('Daniel', 4, 6, "So I made a decree that all the wise men of Babylon should be brought before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream."),
('Daniel', 4, 7, "Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the astrologers came in, and I told them the dream, but they could not make known to me its interpretation."),
('Daniel', 4, 8, "At last Daniel came in before me- he who was named Belteshazzar after the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods- and I told him the dream, saying,"),

('Daniel', 4, 11, "The tree grew and became strong, and its top reached to heaven, and it was visible to the end of the whole earth."),
('Daniel', 4, 12, "Its leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it."),

('Daniel', 4, 17, "The sentence is by the decree of the watchers, the decision by the word of the holy ones, to the end that the living may know that the Most High rules the kingdom of men and gives it to whom he will and sets over it the lowliest of men.'"),
('Daniel', 4, 18, "This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. And you, O Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation, but you are able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.\""),
('Daniel', 4, 19, "Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was dismayed for a while, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king answered and said, \"Belteshazzar, let not the dream or the interpretation alarm you.\" Belteshazzar answered and said, \"My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you and its interpretation for your enemies!"),

('Daniel', 4, 33, "Immediately the word was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from among men and ate grass like an ox, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles' feathers, and his nails were like birds' claws."),
('Daniel', 4, 34, "At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever, for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;"),
