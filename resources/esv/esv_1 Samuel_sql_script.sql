('1 Samuel', 1, 1, "There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 2, "He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 3, "Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 4, "On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 5, "But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 6, "And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 7, "So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 8, "And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, \"Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?\""),

('1 Samuel', 1, 11, "And she vowed a vow and said, \"O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.\""),
('1 Samuel', 1, 12, "As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 13, "Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman."),

('1 Samuel', 1, 15, "But Hannah answered, \"No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 16, "Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.\""),

('1 Samuel', 1, 18, "And she said, \"Let your servant find favor in your eyes.\" Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 19, "They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her."),

('1 Samuel', 1, 23, "Elkanah her husband said to her, \"Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the LORD establish his word.\" So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 24, "And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. And the child was young."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 25, "Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli."),
('1 Samuel', 1, 26, "And she said, \"Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD."),

('1 Samuel', 2, 7, "The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low and he exalts."),
('1 Samuel', 2, 8, "He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and on them he has set the world."),

('1 Samuel', 2, 14, "and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there."),
('1 Samuel', 2, 15, "Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, \"Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw.\""),
('1 Samuel', 2, 16, "And if the man said to him, \"Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,\" he would say, \"No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force.\""),

('1 Samuel', 2, 25, "If someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?\" But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for it was the will of the LORD to put them to death."),

('1 Samuel', 3, 8, "And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, \"Here I am, for you called me.\" Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the young man."),
('1 Samuel', 3, 9, "Therefore Eli said to Samuel, \"Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say, 'Speak, LORD, for your servant hears.'\"So Samuel went and lay down in his place."),
